                    <h5>A brief summary</h5>
                    
                    <p>
                        Gojira tends to operate in polar extremes. 
                        “I can’t help but see humanity as a parasite,” Gojira’s 
                        co-founding guitarist and principal songwriter Joe Duplantier 
                        explains, “and yet the most beautiful things come out of humans.” 
                        To that end, the French quartet—Duplantier and his brother Mario 
                        [drums], Christian Andreu [guitar], and Jean-Michel Labadie [bass]
                        —have spent the past 15 years translating this duality into a distinctive 
                        sound: dark, crushing metal brightened by triumphant arena-rock melodies, 
                        contrast-heavy and emotionally charged.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Enter 2016's Magma, whereupon Gojira found strength—and crossover success—through 
                        a singular commitment to self-reflection. The intensely personal record, penned in 
                        memory of the Duplantier brothers' late mother, was a painful significant turning point 
                        for the French group. It debuted at No. 24 on the Billboard 200 chart, topped the Billboard 
                        “Hard Rock Albums” chart (a first for a French band), and netted nominations for Best Rock 
                        Album and Best Metal Performance (for "Silvera") at the 59th annual Grammy Awards. Numerous 
                        global headlining tours, including a stint with Metallica, followed. Coming out of Magma, 
                        Gojira weren't just one of the biggest metal bands on the scene—they were one of biggest 
                        rock bands in the world, unified and self-emboldened.
                    </p>
                        
                    <hr>
                        
                    <p>
                        Humbled and honored as he was by Magma’s success, Duplantier came out of that victory lap 
                        feeling exhausted—and eager to move on. “Magma marked a sad moment in our lives,” Joe says 
                        of the record. “We were expressing grief, so it was a bit heavy: not only to the process of 
                        making that album, but also talking about it, and playing the songs, and doing all of these 
                        interviews around a difficult time in our lives.”
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>
                        And so, Gojira made a group decision: for album number seven, Fortitude, they’d have some damn 
                        fun. In late 2019, the brothers Duplantier returned to Silver Cord Studio, their Ridgewood, 
                        Queens, headquarters, to begin work on new, self-produced Gojira material, culled from ideas 
                        they’d developed over the past two years. “With this album, we wanted to come back with more 
                        joy, more power, and more positivity about life in general,” Joe explains. “We’re so lucky to do 
                        what we love; it’s not like we were depressed or anything, but we had something in our system to 
                        express—Magma—and we felt like it was time for something else—something that is all about strength.”
