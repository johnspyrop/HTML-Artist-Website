                        Gojira is a French heavy metal band from Ondres. Founded as 
                        Godzilla in 1996, the band's lineup—brothers Joe (lead vocals, 
                        rhythm guitar) and Mario Duplantier (drums), Christian Andreu 
                        (lead guitar), and Jean-Michel Labadie (bass)—has been the 
                        same since the band changed its name to Gojira in 2001. Gojira
                        has been known for their progressive and technical death metal 
                        styles and their spiritual, philosophical, and environmentally-
                        themed lyrics. The band has gone "from the utmost obscurity 
                        during the first half of their career to widespread global 
                        recognition in the second".

                        In 1996, the band settled on the name Godzilla. The idea sprang
                        from the original 1954 kaiju film Godzilla and "the myth of the 
                        big furious atomic lizard ... It was, in our heads, a symbol of 
                        devastating power". Playing straight-ahead death metal with elements 
                        of thrash metal, Godzilla self-released a pair of demo albums 
                        (Victim in 1996 and Possessed in 1997), and toured southwest France.
                        While touring with Immortal, Godzilla received national exposure, developing 
                        a reputation on the French metal scene for their "incendiary riffs". The band
                        recorded Saturate, their third demo album, which was released in the Fall of 
                        1999. The band released Wisdom Comes, their fourth demo album, in 2000. Godzilla 
                        then began writing what they intended as their first full-length album, a project
                        planned since 1996. In 2001, Godzilla was legally compelled to change 
                        its name. They became "Gojira", the rōmaji spelling of "Godzilla". 
                        Inspired by the production quality of an album by a Parisian metal band,
                        Gojira moved to the same Brussels studio to record their debut album, 
                        Terra Incognita. Before entering the recording studio, they asked 
                        friends and family for donations. Although Joe Duplantier said that 
                        Gojira took a long time to write the album, it was recorded in ten days.

                        Gojira has released seven studio 
                        albums, three live DVDs, and is the first French band to top 
                        the Billboard Hard Rock Albums chart. Gojira is considered one 
                        of France's most successful exports to the US. The band has 
                        received Grammy Award nominations for Best Rock Album for Magma 
                        and Best Metal Performance for the singles "Silvera" and 
                        "Amazonia". Gojira holds the record for the loudest concert 
                        (and sound) ever recorded at the Stade de France. Throughout 
                        their career, the band has been involved in environmental, 
                        human- and animal-rights activism.
