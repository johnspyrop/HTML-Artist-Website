                Terra Incognita is Gojira's debut studio album. The title 
                (Latin for "unknown land") refers to the area inside of each man,
                where, according to Hindu legend, Brahma hid the divinity that he
                had taken from humanity for the punishment of its abuse.
                Terra Incognita was written at the time vocalist Joe Duplantier had 
                deliberately moved away from society to live two years in a cabin that 
                he had built. He lived in this cabin in a forest with his girlfriend 
                without electricity and without income. The song "In the Forest" 
                contains a hidden instrumental song called "Terra Inc.". 
                The main piece of the track ends at 5:30 and the hidden song starts 
                at 9:00, giving the song a period of silence lasting 3:30. The song 
                contains complex layers of ambient guitar sounds with various echo and 
                reverb effects. This song ends promptly at 12:11 and closes the album. 
                On the "Reissue version", the song "In the Forest" ends and starts the 
                instrumental hidden song after only 10 seconds of silence.

                From Mars to Sirius is the third studio album by French heavy metal band Gojira. A concept album, 
                From Mars to Sirius relates the resurrection of a dead planet through an interplanetary quest, 
                tackling environmental issues such as climate change and impacts on marine life as well as broader 
                themes of life, death, and rebirth. Explaining the meaning behind the album title, Joe Duplantier 
                said in an interview that "In some cultures, Mars symbolizes war and Sirius peace. I'm simplifying! 
                It is a journey of a state of war, even if in France we are preserved, but it can be a war within 
                us, in our flesh, in our mind, a war with ourselves".
                The song "Flying Whales" is "a homage" to whales and their intelligence. The concept emerged during 
                the second album's tour and resulted in the imagery and artwork for From Mars to Sirius. From Mars to 
                Sirius was released in 2005 to critical acclaim. It has since been ranked amongst the Rolling 
                Stone's 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time.

                The Way of All Flesh is the fourth studio album by French heavy metal band Gojira. The album 
                was released on 13 October 2008 in Europe via Listenable Records and on 14 October in the US 
                through Prosthetic Records. It sold around 4,200 copies in the United States in its first week 
                of release to debut at number 138 on the Billboard 200 chart. It also reached no. 1 on the Top 
                Heatseekers chart and no. 21 on the Top Independent Albums chart. Joe Duplantier revealed to Total 
                Guitar magazine that the album deals with their vision about life and death. "The Way Of All Flesh 
                is everything we have to go through until death. I’m 30 years old now and it’s the first time as a 
                human being that I’ve thought about my own death philosophically, and the time that I have to spend 
                here on Earth. It’s something that we’re all concerned about. But it’s almost taboo. You don’t go 
                to a party and talk about death, right?”

                L'Enfant Sauvage (French for "The Wild Child") is the fifth studio album by French heavy metal 
                band Gojira. It was released 26 June 2012 via Roadrunner Records.
                L'Enfant Sauvage is partly inspired by François Truffaut's film of the same name, which tells the 
                true story of Victor of Aveyron, a child who was found alone in the woods with behaviors closer to 
                a wild animal than a civilized human. "We are part of this world. And also there is this idea that 
                an enfant sauvage, a child that grew up in nature, is not confronted with others, with emotions, 
                with guilt and identity, so it would be a state where you are closer to the essence of things."
                Frontman, guitarist, and songwriter Joe Duplantier spoke about the meaning of the album by saying, 
                "When you become a musician, you don't have a boss telling you what to do so you have to be very 
                responsible." He goes on to say "With freedom comes responsibility, so I'm asking myself, 'What is 
                freedom? What does it mean to me?' L'Enfant Sauvage reflects on that. There's no answer though. 
                There's just life and questions."

                Magma is the sixth studio album by French heavy metal band Gojira. The album was released on 
                17 June 2016 through Roadrunner Records.
                Joe Duplantier relocated to New York City, and construction began on his own recording studio 
                (Silver Cord Studio) in Queens, in November 2014, and his brother Mario joined him there. By April 
                2015, the studio was complete, and the band began recording music.
                The album's sessions were put on hold when Joe and Mario Duplantier's mother fell ill and flew back 
                to France. At this stage, the Duplantier brothers decided to associate the album title with the 
                imagery of the magma in the Earth's core, saying that they "were feeling a mix between memories of 
                the past and a fear of the future, with all the emotions burning inside. Magma is this expression 
                of something boiling inside: we cannot touch it, but eventually, it will erupt. It makes perfect 
                sense for how we were feeling at the time." Their mother subsequently died. The band spent some 
                time touring before returning to the Silver Cord Studio to continue the album's sessions, 
                consequently taking on a darker tone.
                The writing process for Magma differed from previous albums, with Joe Duplantier saying that "We do 
                things a little differently. We dump songs, we dump riffs, which we never did before. [In the past] 
                we would prepare 12 songs, get in the studio and record them just exactly as they are on the demos. 
                We decided to do it differently this time." The musical orientation of the album was intended to 
                be "more mature, less visceral", and they also tried to refine the music; "it was a real challenge 
                to develop simplified things on drums", said Mario Duplantier. Bassist Jean-Michel Labadie noted 
                that they desired more breathing in the compositions. About the album's general direction Joe 
                Duplantier stated: "We want a short album. Something less epic than what we usually do. People's 
                attentions are shorter now. So a lot of the songs are four minutes." He also stated: "We have 
                some Pantera-ish kind of riffs, which is kind of new for us. But [...] we want riffs to be a little 
                punchier sometimes." Two months would be required to record the vocals. The mixing of the album 
                was completed in February 2016.

                Fortitude is the seventh studio album by French heavy metal band Gojira. The album was released 
                on 30 April 2021 through Roadrunner Records. Gojira's ambition was to write a more cohesive and 
                brighter album than Magma, emphasizing a progressive sound while incorporating guitar solos and 
                classic rock elements with a positive lyrical message.
                The creative process of Gojira's seventh album began sparingly in late 2017. Gojira intended to 
                write a "groovy, aerated album" with a strong theme and focused on sharing with the audience, an 
                album where two energies coexist, "both very masculine and feminine". The album was inspired as 
                an encouragement to self-reinforcement, "to show courage to face up the world, to face tomorrow's 
                problems". Having had sustained requests to tour worldwide in support of Magma, beyond the initial 
                cycle, Gojira declined in order to focus on writing a new album.
