# HTML-Artist-Website

For a school project, i was tasked with creating a website for an artist of my choosing using HTML. Also, was allowed to utilise bootstrap. I chose to create a website for the French Metal Band Gojira.

For starters, i created a navbar which links to all the other pages and the artist's social media.
I also implemented bootstrap's icons for the social media buttons. Five pages were created: 

1)The Index

2)The About Page

3)The Music Page

4)The Ticket Reservation Page

5)The Contact Page

Each page has it's own custom CSS class which sets the background accordingly. CSS was also utilised in case i needed to set my font color according to each page's needs. Lastly, i created a class that sets the video containers in the Music Page in whichever size i desire.
